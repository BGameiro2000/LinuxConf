# BGameiro's Linux Configurations

This repository consists of all information related to Linux in my systems.

That information is divided in 5 modules:

*   [Dotfiles](./LinuxDots)
    *   This submodule has all information regarding my system configurations.
<br><br>
*   [ArchLinux ISO](./ArchIso)
    *   This submodule has the configurations used to create an ArchLinux Iso with the configurations from my dotfiles so that anyone can test them in a live environment.
<br><br>
*   [Pacman Repo](./ArchRepo)
    *   This submodule has the PKGBUILDs that I use to create my own packages and is the host for my custom pacman repository.
<br><br>
*   [Documents and Guides](./LinuxDocs)
    *   This submodule has any information, guide, resource and list that I may create in order to help my Linux journey. This is where my installation guides, recommendations and lists of recommended software, websites and forums are.
<br><br>
*   [Scripts](./LinuxScripts)
    *   This submodule has all the scripts that I use. Including installation and configuration scripts for ArchLinux.
